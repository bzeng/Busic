Title : I See Fire

Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire
Then we shall all burn together
Watch the flames climb high
Into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

And if we should die tonight
We should all die together
Raise a glass of wine
For the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns
Then my brothers will die
And as this sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire
Oh you know I saw a city burning (Fire)
And I see fire
Feel the heat upon my skin (Fire)
And I see fire
Oo oo ooo ooooooo (Fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside
